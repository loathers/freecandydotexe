**freecandy.exe** is a script meant to farm the recurring [Halloween](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Halloween) holiday within the [Kingdom of Loathing](https://www.kingdomofloathing.com/). On Halloween, players can derive high profits by visiting the infinitely recurring trick-or-treating blockss; this script aims to run your treat-filled Halloween turns in the quickest way possible. 

To install, run the following command on an up-to-date KolMafia version:

```
git checkout loathers/freecandydotexe release
```

## Running freecandy

In its simplest form, running freecandy just requires running the following command in the mafia GCLI:

```
freecandy 10
```

Where "10" would be replaced by an integer telling the script how many blocks you would like to run while trick-or-treating. If you do not include a number after `freecandy`, the script will just run until you're out of adventures. This script will use the familiar you have equipped as your primary fight familiar; pick the familiar you want freecandy to use prior to the invocation of the script.
